# Project Description
This dashboard allows you to look up a simple weather forecast for cities of your choice. It uses the OpenWeather API to fill in information about the city in question, providing you with current weather information as well as a 5 day forecast.

When you enter a city, a button will be generated that allows you to return to that city's current weather.

UV Index Severity is indicated by a number, as well as green for low, yellow for moderate, and red for severe.
